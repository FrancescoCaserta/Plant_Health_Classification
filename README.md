# Plant_Health_Classification
The aim of this project was to classify the health status of plants based on low-resolution images (96x96x3). We explored various techniques for image preprocessing and analysis to identify outliers and balance the classes. Subsequently, we employed custom CNNs and well-known CNNs using transfer learning and fine-tuning. Additionally, we applied ensemble methods to the best models and incorporated test-time augmentation.
